    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to stand on the surface of Mars and look up at a pale blue dot in
        the sky — our own Earth, hanging there like a faraway lantern? Mars has been a canvas for human imagination for
        centuries, from ancient myths and fiery omens in the night sky to science fiction epics of the 20th century.
        Once, we dreamed of canals built by alien civilizations; now we send high-tech rovers, landers, and orbiters to
        uncover the planet’s true story.</p>

    <p>But Mars is not just a rusty sphere orbiting the Sun. It’s a world of frozen volcanoes taller than Mount Everest,
        of canyons so vast they would stretch across continents on Earth, and of dust storms that can swallow the entire
        planet for weeks. Its thin atmosphere and bitter cold would make survival a challenge, yet it offers enough
        tantalizing hints of water — past and present — to keep scientists asking: could life have ever existed
        here?</p>

    <p>Every mission to Mars is a gamble with physics, engineering, and human patience. The Red Planet has a habit of
        swallowing spacecraft — earning the nickname “the spacecraft graveyard” in the early years of exploration. Yet,
        with each failure came new lessons, and with each success came breathtaking views and groundbreaking data. The
        Soviet Mars 3, NASA’s Viking landers, the tireless Spirit and Opportunity rovers, and the high-tech Perseverance
        — they are all part of a long, unfolding story.</p>

    <p>In this project, we’ll journey through that story together. We’ll explore the missions, the myths, the
        photographs, and the human drive that pushes us toward this small, cold neighbor. Whether you’re here to learn
        about ancient Martian legends, to see real images from the planet’s surface, or to understand the science behind
        the exploration, you’ve landed in the right place. Welcome to — your gateway to the Red Planet. — your gateway
        to the Red Planet.</p>
